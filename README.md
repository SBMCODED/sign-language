 This project contains different signs such as A-Z and 0-9. 
 The aim of the project is to develop a model to predict the sign language
 convolutional neural networks is used for training the dataset, then after getting the accuracy, confusion matrix was been done then
  I make use of 'Random' to select any language from the dataset and show the accuracy of the prediction
